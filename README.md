AI-Powered System for Techno-Fundamental Analysis of Indian Options

This document outlines a sophisticated command-line application designed to function as an AI-powered techno-fundamental analyst for the Indian equity and options market. The system utilizes a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture, integrated with a live data feed from Yahoo Finance, to generate detailed, data-driven options trading strategies for constituents of the Nifty 50 index.
Core Features

    Real-Time Market Data Integration: The system dynamically fetches real-time stock prices, comprehensive financial summaries, and options chain data for specified securities through the yfinance library.

    Advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System: A ChromaDB vector database is employed to retrieve contextually relevant options strategies, which are then synthesized with live financial data to inform the generative model.

    Comprehensive Techno-Fundamental Analysis: The generative AI is prompted to perform a holistic analysis, evaluating both technical indicators, such as price action, and fundamental metrics, including Return on Equity (ROE) and revenue growth, to formulate its recommendations.

    Extensive Market Coverage: The application is capable of providing analysis for any of the 50 constituent stocks of the Nifty index, in addition to the Nifty 50 index itself (^NSEI).

    Enhanced Command-Line Interface: The user interacts with the system through a rich, professionally formatted, and user-friendly command-line interface, facilitated by the rich library.

Setup and Installation Procedures

The following instructions provide a comprehensive guide for the local deployment and configuration of the application.
1. Repository Cloning

First, clone the project repository to your local machine and navigate into the project directory.

git clone <your-repository-url>
cd ai-options-analyst

2. Virtual Environment Configuration

It is a standard best practice to utilize a virtual environment for dependency management to avoid conflicts with system-level packages.

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows systems, use the command: `venv\Scripts\activate`

3. Dependency Installation

Install all requisite Python packages as specified in the requirements.txt file.

pip install -r requirements.txt

4. API Key Configuration

The application requires a Gemini API key for its generative capabilities. For security purposes, this key should be configured as an environment variable.

For macOS/Linux Systems:

export GEMINI_API_KEY='your_actual_api_key'

For Windows Command Prompt:

set GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key

Application Execution

Upon successful completion of the setup and installation procedures, the application can be executed using the following command:

python main.py
